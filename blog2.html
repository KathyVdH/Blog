			That was the cry heard from Quidditch players across the nation last night as it
			became clear that the Department of Magical Games and Sports had decided to burn
			the baskets used for centuries for goalscoring in Quidditch. "We're not burning
			them, don't exaggerate," said an irritable-looking Departmental representative
			last night when asked to comment.

			"Baskets, as you may have noticed, come in different
			sizes. We have found it impossible to standardise basket size so as to make goalposts
			throughout Britain equal. Surely you can see it's a matter of fairness. I mean,
			there's a team up near Barnton, they've got these minuscule little baskets attached
			to the opposing team's posts, you couldn't get a grape in them. And up their own end
			 they've got these great wicker caves swinging around. It's not on. We've settled on
				a fixed hoop size and that's it. Everything nice and fair." At this point,
				the Departmental representative was forced to retreat under a hail of baskets
				thrown by the angry demonstrators assembled in the hall. Although the ensuing
				riot was later blamed on goblin agitators, there can be no doubt that Quidditch
				fans across Britain are tonight mourning the end of the game as we know it.
				" 'T won't be t' same wi'out baskets," said one apple-cheeked old wizard sadly.
				"I remember when I were a lad, we used to set fire to 'em for a laugh during t' match.
				You can't do that with goal hoops. 'Alf t' fun's gone."
